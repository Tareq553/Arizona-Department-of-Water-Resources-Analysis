# Arizona Department of Water Resources Analysis

## Project Details
Water is a precious resource, and the sustainability of water usage is a critical issue, particularly in regions facing water scarcity, such as Arizona. The '**Arizona Department of Water Resources Analysis**' project aims to contribute to the understanding of water usage patterns and trends in Arizona. This project uses data analysis techniques and linear regression to predict future demand for the four major water sources in Arizona: Effluent, Groundwater, CAP, and Surface Water.

## Problem Statement:
The aim of this project is to analyze the annual water supply and demand in Arizona, with a focus on the four major water sources: Effluent, Groundwater, CAP, and Surface Water. The goal is to use historical data from 1985 to 2020 to predict future demand for these water sources.

## Motivation:
Arizona faces significant challenges with water supply and demand, and it is crucial to understand trends and patterns in water usage to inform sustainable management and planning. This project seeks to contribute to that understanding by analyzing historical data. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into the sustainability of current water usage practices and identify areas for improvement. Additionally, **this project serves as an opportunity to learn and practice data analysis**.
